# Thread Management and Synchronization with Meyer Singleton and RAII


This code demonstrates the use of multithreading, synchronization, and the Meyer's Singleton pattern in C++. The main functionality is distributed across multiple threads that run concurrently, while the Meyer's Singleton pattern is used to manage thread count.

Important components:

ThreadCountProxy: This struct implements the Meyer's Singleton pattern. It keeps track of the number of threads and provides static methods to increment, decrement, and wait for all threads to complete.

ThreadCount: This class is a helper class that increments and decrements the thread count using ThreadCountProxy when it is constructed and destructed, respectively.

A, B, C, and D: These classes inherit from BannerBase, which is not shown in the code. They each have an operator() method that takes a std::future<void> reference as an argument. Inside the method, they perform a specific task, check the future's status, and exit the loop if the future is ready.

Controller: This class also inherits from BannerBase and has an operator() method that takes a std::promise<void> rvalue reference as an argument. It sets the promise's value to signal the other threads to stop and waits for all the threads to complete using ThreadCountProxy::WaitUntilThreadsDone().

main(): This function sets up the threads and starts them with the appropriate classes and promises/futures. It also creates a future for the Controller object, which is either launched in deferred mode or async mode, depending on the code version. The program waits for a key press, and when detected, it calls fuController.get() to allow the Controller to signal the other threads to stop and wait for their completion.

# Key points:

1) Meyer's Singleton pattern ensures that there is only one instance of ThreadCountProxy.

2) Threads are created for the classes A, B, C, D, and Controller.

3) Thread synchronization is achieved using std::mutex, std::condition_variable, std::lock_guard, and std::unique_lock.

4) The Controller object is responsible for signaling the other threads to stop and waiting for their completion.


# Understanding the Role of Singleton in Managing Shared State in a Multithreaded C++ Program

let's break down the code and the role of the Singleton in this implementation.

The primary purpose of the code is to manage a set of concurrently running threads (A, B, C, D, and Controller). Each thread performs a specific task, and when a key is pressed, the Controller signals them to stop. The ThreadCountProxy Singleton is used to manage the number of active threads and provide a way to wait for all threads to finish.

Here's how the Singleton pattern is utilized in the code:

The ThreadCountProxy class is designed as a Singleton, which means that it can only have one instance throughout the entire lifetime of the program. The privGetInstance() method is responsible for creating this single instance and returning a reference to it.

The ThreadCountProxy class contains methods to increment, decrement, and wait for the thread count to reach zero. These methods are static, meaning that they can be called without an object instance. However, since they need to access the shared state (the thread count and related synchronization objects), they internally call privGetInstance() to obtain a reference to the Singleton instance.


The ThreadCount class is a helper class that automatically increments and decrements the thread count when it is created and destroyed, respectively. It uses the static methods provided by the ThreadCountProxy Singleton to do so.


The threads A, B, C, and D each create an instance of the ThreadCount class. As a result, the thread count is incremented when the threads start and decremented when they finish.


The Controller thread waits for a key press and then signals the other threads to stop by setting the value of the shared std::promise<void>. After that, it calls ThreadCountProxy::WaitUntilThreadsDone() to wait for all threads to complete. This method uses the Singleton instance to check the current thread count and wait for it to reach zero.


In summary, the Singleton pattern is used to create a single, shared instance of the ThreadCountProxy class that manages the thread count state across all threads. The pattern ensures that the state is centralized, thread-safe, and resource-efficient, making it an effective solution for managing shared state in a multithreaded environment.
